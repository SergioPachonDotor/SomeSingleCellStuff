ImproperOutputException in line 29 of /home/sergio/desktop/loka/snakefile:
Outputs of incorrect type (directories when expecting files or vice versa). Output directories must be flagged with directory(). for rule create_output_dirs:
output/first_analysis/tissue1
Removing output files of failed job create_output_dirs since they might be corrupted:
output/first_analysis/tissue1, output/first_analysis/tissue3, output/first_analysis/tissue2, output/second_analysis/tissue1, output/second_analysis/tissue3, output/second_analysis/tissue2
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
